; Prints one "FILE NAME LENGTH" line per maximal ladder at or above the
; threshold, for tools/check/if-ladders.sh to aggregate per function and check
; against tools/contract/if-ladders.txt.
;
; `match` is an engine primitive and the flat way to write a decision with more
; than a couple of arms; a chain of `if`s nested through their else branches
; says the same thing one indent deeper per arm. This reads the file as
; s-expressions (never evaluates it), because an `if` ladder is a shape a grep
; cannot see. Symbol comparison is by name -- symbols intern per base.
;
; The .scm files are out of scope: this walker reads the file it is handed and
; does not follow includes, and those files are Scheme, where `cond` is the
; primitive. The .x files under r7rs/x/ are in scope and read the same way.
