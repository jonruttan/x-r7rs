;
; Prints one "FILE NAME LENGTH" line per MAXIMAL ladder at or above the
; threshold, for tools/check/if-ladders.sh to aggregate per function and check
; against the manifest in tools/contract/if-ladders.txt.
;
; WHY THIS IS A CHECK AT ALL.  `match` is an engine PRIMITIVE and the flat way
; to write a decision with more than a couple of arms; a chain of `if`s nested
; through their else branches says the same thing one indent deeper per arm,
; and reads worse the longer it gets.  Every arm after the third is a reason to
; use the primitive that exists for this.
;
; STRUCTURAL, not a grep: an `if` ladder is a shape, and the shape is only
; knowable by reading the file as s-expressions.  The file is parsed, never
; evaluated.  Symbol comparison is by NAME -- symbols intern per base, so a
; symbol read here is not eq? to one written here.
;
; THE .scm FILES ARE OUT OF SCOPE BY CONSTRUCTION, not by an exclusion list.
; r7rs/base.x reaches them with `include-once` and this walker does not follow
; an include -- it reads the file it is handed and nothing else.  Those files
; are Scheme, where `cond` is the primitive and this shape is not the question.
; The .x files under r7rs/x/ arrive the same way and ARE in scope: they are x,
; and the sweep names files rather than following includes, so each is read
; once on its own and its ladders are reported under its own name.

  ; THE GUARD STAYS ON, and the walker is written to fit under it.  Removing
  ; it to stop a truncated report only moved the failure: with no ceiling this
  ; walk took a 7GB CI runner down, and the job came back "canceled" with no
  ; error of its own.  What made it hungry was allocating a CLOSURE PER NODE
  ; (a lambda handed to a list walker) in a runtime with no automatic GC --
  ; so the walk below allocates none, and each top-level form is swept before
  ; the next.

  ; THREE BINDERS, BECAUSE THIS BUNDLE IS WRITTEN IN TWO SURFACES, and that
  ; is not a corner case here -- it is SEVEN OF TEN MODULES.  r7rs/base.x and
  ; its two neighbours are loaded before the Scheme vocabulary exists and say
  ; `def`; everything under r7rs/x/ is `include-once`d after it and says
  ; `define`, in the plain and the curried spelling both.
  ;
  ; A checker that knew only `def` -- which is what the sibling bundles
  ; started from -- reported every ladder in those seven files under an EMPTY
  ; name, which is worse than missing them.  The report has three fields and
  ; the aggregate keys on the first two, so a blank middle field slides the
  ; depth into the name and leaves the count empty; the manifest would have
  ; been built out of rows that named nothing.  Measured, not reasoned about:
  ; with the threshold dropped to 1 so every chain shows, this bundle reports
  ; 29 of them -- and before this, 27 of the 29 came back with no name.
  ;
