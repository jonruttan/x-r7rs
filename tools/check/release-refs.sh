# THE SAME RULING AS tests/spec-runner.sh, and for the same reason: this check
# is identical in every bundle, so a copy per repository buys nothing and costs
# an N-repo re-vendor for every fix.  It was written twice before it moved to
# the platform, and the second copy needed three fixes backported the day it
# was written.
#
# TWO WAYS TO REACH THE KIT, because this check needs no platform to run.  It
# reads lang.xon and greps the tree; forcing an x onto it would turn a
# one-second text check into a build.  So X_LANG_KIT names a checkout's
# tools/lang-kit directly -- what CI uses, having checked x-lang out already --
# and everything else falls back to asking x where its share tree is.
