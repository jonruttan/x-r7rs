# release-refs.sh -- a version this bundle DECLARES is named once, and gated.
#
# lang.xon carries two of them:
#
#   (requires-release "vN.N.N")        the x-lang this bundle was built against
#   (requires-lang "r5rs" "vN.N.N")    the lang it is written on top of
#
# Everything else naming either -- the README's status line, a workflow, a doc
# -- is a COPY, and a copy nobody checks goes stale on the next release and
# tells the next reader something false.  The bundle keeps working, the suite
# stays green, and the only symptom is a claim about a pairing nobody tested.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A CLAIM: a version string preceded, within 24 characters, by
# the name it belongs to.  Proximity is the whole mechanism -- every version in
# this tree is the same shape, and only what it sits beside says whether it is
# x-lang's, x-r5rs's, this bundle's or the engine's.
#
# `x-lang#527` IS AN ISSUE, NOT A RELEASE.  A `#` between the name and the
# version disqualifies the pair; without that this fires on r5rs/aliases.x in
# the r5rs bundle, where an issue reference and an ENGINE version share a line
# and neither is a claim about a platform.
#
# WHY awk AND NOT A REGEX WINDOW.  The first version of this used
# `name[^#]\{0,24\}vN.N.N` and was wrong the moment two versions shared a line:
# POSIX has no lazy quantifier, so the greedy window steps over the near
# version and pairs the name with the FAR one.  This bundle's README says
# "against x-lang v0.7.0 and x-r5rs v0.2.0" and would have reported x-lang as
# claiming v0.2.0.  Scanning version-first and looking BACKWARD has no such
# ambiguity.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS EXPLICIT, because history is worth writing down: a line
# carrying `release-ref: history` is skipped, and having to say so is the point.
