# @description A ratchet over tools/contract/if-ladders.txt: the nested-if debt
#   may only shrink, and it is checked in both directions.

#
# Reports every MAXIMAL nested-if ladder of four arms or more in this bundle's
# x modules, aggregated per function as "FILE NAME COUNT LONGEST", and diffs
# that against tools/contract/if-ladders.txt in BOTH directions:
#
#   - a function absent from the manifest FAILS.  Write it as a match.
#   - more ladders, or a longer one, than the manifest allows FAILS.  The debt
#     may only shrink.
#   - a manifest row that has improved, or gone, FAILS until the row is
#     lowered or deleted -- so the file cannot rot into a list of things that
#     are fine.
#
# The manifest is the debt this check was born with, not a licence: every row
# is a function that should become a match, and the file may only get smaller.
#
# Set X to point at a particular x; otherwise the one on PATH is used.  The
# checker itself is x -- an if ladder is a SHAPE, and reading the file as
# s-expressions is the only way to see one.  A grep would count parens.
#
# NOT A GLOB, because a glob only sees one directory deep and this bundle keeps
# seven of its ten modules under r7rs/x/ -- r7rs/*.x would leave most of the
# bundle unchecked.  `find` also means a module directory that grows a
# subdirectory later does not quietly open a hole in the gate.  The .scm
# sources beside them are Scheme -- `cond` is the primitive there and this
# shape is not the question -- so only *.x is fed in.
