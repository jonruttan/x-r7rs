# NOT ONE PATH INTO THE X-LANG SOURCE TREE.  The 2024 runner reached the
# platform as "$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../tests/spec-runner.sh" and both that and
# its X_BIN dangled the moment the personality left the repo -- the failure
# x-lang docs/personality-contract.md calls "addressing, not sharing".
# Everything here comes from x itself: --share-dir says which tree x reads
# from (repo root in a checkout, share/x installed) and --engine-path says
# where the engine is after the wrapper's full discovery order.
#
# Set X to point at a particular x; otherwise the one on PATH is used.

# ASKED FROM THE WRAPPER'S OWN DIRECTORY, and that is not a stylistic choice.
# x.sh detects repo mode by testing for lib/x.x under the CWD, so --share-dir
# answers with `pwd` in a checkout -- correct only when the caller already
# stands in the x-lang repo, which a bundle by definition does not.  Asked
# from anywhere else a checkout's wrapper reports
#   Error: install root does not exist: .../x-lang/../share/x
# and the flag whose own comment says it exists "so a tool outside this
# repository can ASK instead of guessing" cannot be asked from outside.
#
# cd'ing to the wrapper's directory first makes the detection true for both
# modes: a checkout's x.sh sits beside lib/x.x, and an installed x sits in
# bin/ where lib/x.x is absent, so the install branch runs as designed.
# Reported upstream; remove this dance once --share-dir answers from any cwd.
