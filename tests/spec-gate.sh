# THE SAME RULING AS tools/check/release-refs.sh, and this file is the case
# that proved it right: three bundles carried a byte-identical copy differing
# only in the name on line 2, and the trap bug -- a killed suite that could
# report SUCCESS -- had to be fixed in all three on the same day.  The kit's
# copy (x-lang#564) is the one that keeps the fix; v0.10.0 is the first
# release to carry it, which is the release this bundle pairs with.
#
# X_LANG_KIT names a checkout's tools/lang-kit directly -- what CI uses,
# having checked x-lang out already; otherwise the kit is found where x says
# its share tree is.  Unlike release-refs this gate RUNS the suite, so an x
# is needed either way -- the fallback costs nothing extra.
