# @description Runs the spec suite and compares its failures to

# WHY THIS EXISTS.  spec-runner.sh exits non-zero on any failure, which is
# right for a developer at a prompt and wrong for a gate: a bundle carrying
# honest, documented debt is then permanently unreleasable, and release.yml
# refuses to publish anything ever.  The choice that leaves is between fixing
# every last spec before the first release and making the gate advisory, and
# neither is good.
#
# So the gate asks a better question than "did anything fail".  It asks whether
# what failed is what we said would fail.
#
# BY NAME, NOT BY COUNT.  A budget of "9 failures" is satisfied by fixing one
# and breaking another, which is the exact event a ratchet is for.  This
# compares the SET of failing test names, so a swap is caught.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE RED.  A failure that is not recorded is a regression.  A
# recorded failure that now passes is a fix that nobody wrote down, and leaving
# it listed would quietly re-authorise the failure later.  x-lang's
# percent-globals gate takes the same line, and for the same reason: an
# unrecorded gain is budget someone can spend without noticing.
#
# Set X to point at a particular x; otherwise the one on PATH is used.  Every
# variable spec-runner.sh honours (X_BIN, SPEC_PATH, ...) is honoured here,
# because this runs that script rather than reimplementing it.

# THE HANDLER HAS TO EXIT, and not doing so is how a KILLED suite reported a
# filesystem error instead.
#
# This was `trap 'rm -rf "$work"' EXIT INT TERM`.  On a signal the handler ran,
# removed the work directory, and then FELL THROUGH to the next line -- which
# writes into the directory it had just removed.  A suite killed by an OOM, a
# runaway guard or a cancelled CI job surfaced as
#
#     spec-gate.sh: 58: cannot create /tmp/tmp.XXXX/clean: Directory nonexistent
#
# and exit 143, naming neither the signal nor the suite.  Worse, it defeats the
# "a suite that did not run is not a suite that passed" check below by never
# reaching it -- the one guard written specifically so a suite that never ran
# cannot be mistaken for a green one.
#
# So EXIT cleans up, and a signal cleans up, SAYS which signal, and re-raises
# itself with the trap cleared -- so the parent sees a death by signal rather
# than an ordinary status, which is what a CI runner reads to tell "cancelled"
# from "failed".
